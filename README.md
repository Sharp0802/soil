Simple OpenGL Image Library (SOIL)
==================================

> [!NOTE]
> This repo only lets the original SOIL library use CMake and the newer version of `stb_image`

## Introduction

SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL.
It is based on `stb_image`, the public domain code from Sean Barrett (found
here). It has been extended to load TGA and DDS files, and to perform common
functions needed in loading OpenGL textures. SOIL can also be used to save
and load images in a variety of formats.
